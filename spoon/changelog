	. Ridiculous logging in the ATAPI driver.


27-04-2005

	. There are now seperate hard and soft entries

	  revelation about the Threads using the 
	  half-constructed objects.
	  

18-02-2005

	. Lots of changes to the kernel in order to 
	  support multiple schedulers. Also, I did this
	  so that it would be easier to delete, finish
	  and crash processes and threads.
	. Modification to the way IRQ's work slightly.
	  They now have to acknowledge the interrupt
	  that they were servicing. Good idea? dunno.

	  exist.
	. Improved the ConsoleView.  


04-02-2005

	. Playing with the mpeg2decode application and it
	  actually plays movies now. On screen. In the GUI.
	  It works.  Cool huh?  It just kind of worked.
	  

03-02-2005

	. Created an "auto" fs type so that the FileSystem
	  classes will test the device until a suitable
	  FileSystem is found. The first compatible match.
	. Modified the CDROM iso9660 FS driver so that it's
	  case insensitive.
	. Modified the init program to accept parameters.
	. Added the "root=[device]" parameter to the init
	  program so that the grub menu can specify the
	  root device. FS is "auto" by default.
	. Modified the kbd driver to use the Driver class. So
	  now init can wait for all processes to start up
	  successfully.

	. Fixed the Window problem. Basically, it was my
	  attempt to make Run() automatically split itself
	  if it was _threaded and the programmer and called
	  Run() directly.  Now I'm assuming that the 
	  programmer knows what he/she's doing.
	. Fixed the floppy.conf file.


31-01-2005

	. Lots of changes to the consoles in the kernel
	  and the kernel libraries.
	. Modifications to the kernel make the consoles
	  dynamic.
	. The kernel now also keeps the active_pid value
	  in it's own console structure.
	. The libkernel now has a mode attached to the
	  console structures it uses. The modes are either
	  VC_MODE_MESSAGE or VC_MODE_BUFFER. Buffer is the
	  normal text mode whereas Message sends a Pulse
	  to the specified receipient.
	. This is the initial implementation. It will 
	  probably change to get better.

26-01-2005

	. Created a ScrollBar, Scrollable class and
	  improved the ListView to support them.

24-01-2005

	. Created a TextInput and incorporated all the
	  new classes into the spoon library.

	. VFS working again.
	. Shell sends command line parameters for the run command.
	. Successfully ran mpeg2decode from inside the system.


03-01-2005

	. Imported the MPEG2 player code from mpeg.org
	  into the apps/mpeg2decode directory. It compiles
	  successfully but needs the file IO and a few math
	  functions.
	. Beginning of the math.c implementation of the
	  libc library.
	. Modified init to wait for the server ports to open.

28-12-2004

15-11-2004

	. Made the VFS a little more tolerant. 
	. Added a List method to the FileSystem class
	  in the VFS.
	. Implemented the List method in the iso9660 fs
	  so now you can list the contents of a CD.

14-11-2004
	
	. Incorporated the ext2fs file system into the
	  VFS. It successfully detects and loads the
	  file system. However, I need to fix it. It doesn't
	  read the correct files.
	. Modified the ata driver to support partitions.
	  So now there are devices that look like this: 
	  /device/storage/hda0 and so on.

13-11-2004

	. Added a Size and Stat call to the File class. 
	. The VFS now supports FS based files.

	. Added cat and more to the shell.


11-11-2004

	. Damn stupid bug in the atapi driver which wouldn't
	  read anything more than 1 sector correctly. I wasted
	  HOURS on it.


06-11-2004

	. Cleaned up the ATA driver and implemented the nice 
	  read and write methods.
	. Created the ATAPI driver and it now successfully reads
	  CD's and it ejects. 


04-11-2004

	. A working ATA driver that needs to be cleaned up.

31-10-2004

	. Finished the Exchange class. It's pretty cool. I wonder
	  if I should integrate it into the Messenger class and
	  then there won't be any hassle with remember where
	  to send what and how to send it.
	. Complete a rudimentary File class. Read, Write, Open, Close
	  and Seek all work.
	. The VFS seems to work for device nodes.
 	. Converted the old IDE driver to the new class.
	. Made the File::Seek, VFS and DeviceNode operations use
	  64 signed bits for position.
	. Beginnings of an ATA driver.


30-10-2004

	. Created an Exchange class which is going to
	  allow to asynchronous communication with 
	  replies.
	  

29-10-2004

	. Created the VFS server and a DeviceNode class.
	. Created a rudimentary File class.

28-10-2004

	. Created a View class. You can add them to Windows
	  now.


27-10-2004

	. Created a wm directory for the new window managers
	  and I've also created a new interface/WindowManager
	  class.
	. I've added hooks into the gui_server to inform
	  the WindowManager of any events.
	  

24-10-2004

	. lots & lots. The Window class and the new gui_server
	  are coming along nicely.

18-10-2004

	. The kernel library now initialises the constructors
	  list and runs the desctructor list.
	. Geez.. so much trouble but it's all working now.
	. Added a Driver class which is a descendent of
	  Application.

17-10-2004

	. A new direction with the renaming of the spoon
	  library to libbe and a whole new spoon library
	  to my own tastes.

03-10-2004

	. Acquisition of an IRQ now unmasks the IRQ 
	  if it was masked.


30-09-2004

	. Re-implemented the window section syncing.
	. Further implemented the String class in
	  spoon library. All operators work.
	. Cleaned up the openunix and posix libraries. 
	  I haven't implemented them properly
	  yet.
	. Created an InfoApp to give new users some
	  information.
	. Updated the floppy.conf and uploaded a new
	  floppy image.

	. Implemented the WindowActivated stuff too.
	. Implemented other stuff in the Window class.
	
	

28-09-2004

	. Lots of changes to the spoon library regarding
	  windows, themes, etc. Themes are now handled by
	  the application itself.
	. Changes to the app_server to support the new
	  library changes.

18-09-2004

	. Further work on the cd player. I added a volume bar but
	  it doesn't work.
	. Update the floppy configuration.
	  

17-09-2004

	. The kernel now masks any unhandled IRQ's.
	. It also doesn't print out unhandled warnings
	  in lfb mode.
	. I also created the cd player application.

09-09-2004

	. Changed the idea of the consoles. Now there
	  are several kernel consoles with shared pages
	  between processes which are attached a single
	  console.
	. Added new system calls to reflect the changes.
	. Added new library calls to reflect the changes.
	. Modified init to move everything that isn't the
	  shell to console number 2.
	

03-09-2004

	. The new capability thingy is now in place. Access
	  to all the system calls can be granted/revoked at
	  will to remote or local threads. The system is 
	  thread-bound.


02-09-2004

	. kernel: process_id -> pid
	. kernel: thread_id -> tid
	. Lots of changes to prepare for the capabilities as well
	  as some cleaning up and documentation.


26-08-2004

	. I was messing around with the app_server and now it
	  has special effects and stuff. I wonder how long they
	  will last.
	. I increased the size of pulses from 4 pieces of 
	  information to 6 pieces of information.
	. Fixed that bug in the app_server which crashed it on
	  window closing. I was removing a pointer from a List
	  and the return value is a bool but I was using it
	  as the removed pointer. dah.
	. The kernel now prints output to the LFB buffer now
	  when it's in LFB mode.
	

25-08-2004

	. I kinda included a random number pool in the kernel. I
	  don't know how random it is.
	. I also implemented the atexit() and exit() functions of
	  C99 in libc.
	

23-08-2004

	. Improved the printf function in libc - more in
	  line the standard gcc printf.
	. Improved the conio_* functions in libkernel.
	. Created a sprintf function.
	. Quickly fixed the DeskBar to print the correct
	  time.


22-08-2004

	. I created a NetConfig class which allows the programmer
	  to manipulate the net_server configuration. Interface
	  and routing information can be changed.
	. Added some additional functions to the shell: route,
	  ifconfig, reboot, clear.
	. Update the floppy.conf

20-08-2004

	. I got the ARP replies working again. I was replying
	  with the ARP_Packet->Length() length which is 
	  incorrect. I will need to look at this and determine
	  what it should be.

19-08-2004

	. Modified the shell to contain a function 
	  directory with a function list.  The functions
	  themselves are implemented in their own "main"
	  functions.
	. net_server: ARP packets are spliced up into their
	  own queue and dealt with separately along with
	  being sent to the stack for userland sniffers.
	. net_server: ARP replies are generated manually now.
	. Packet.h classes now have a Create function
	  for each which causes the packet to become the owner.
	. Exception relocations are now also given kernel stacks to 
	  prevent further exceptions.
	. Note to self: be careful of inheritance in Packet.h
	. Packets to transmit are now queued and then transmitted
	  by a separate thread.


18-08-2004

	. Further work on the ARP daemon.
	. Kernel IRQ handling now breaks out of an IRQ
	  servicing request after a certain amount of
	  time.
	. All ARP traffic now goes straight to the
	  ARP daemon.
	. Incoming packets in the net_server are now
	  queued up for a separate thread to handle.


17-08-2004

	. Created a basic ARP daemon for the net_server. It
	  doesn't work yet.

16-08-2004

	. I'm creating a DJFS file system driver in order
	  to experiment with my new vfs_server design.
	. Created a RAMDisk driver. Two RAMDisks are created
	  by default.
	. Continued work on the net_server. I think I have
	  basic routing in place.

15-08-2004
	
	. Improved the networking code by adding 
	  the InterfaceManager and RouteManager.
	. Using everything I've learnt by doing the
	  net_server to rewrite the vfs_server.

12-08-2004

	. Improved the RawSocket class to include
	  proper return codes, correct messaging,
	  decent registration, etc. 
	. Improved the net_server to accomodate
	  processes/sockets/binds.
	. Implemented a transmission attempt.


08-08-2004

	. Created a spoon/network/RawSocket class which
	  can bind to sockets in the net_server. Data is
	  transferred using the new message system.
	. Modified tester1 to display ARP messages.
	. Modified tester2 to display UDP messages.
	. Created tester3 to display IP messages.
	. Created a sniffer app to display all packets
	  from the network.


07-08-2004

	. Modified the pulse and message calls to send directly
	  to threads now as opposed to a single process entry
	  point. This is done to speed up my socket code.


06-08-2004

	. Added messages into the kernel and the kernel library.
	. All "pulse_handler" functions and references have 
	  been changed to "ipc_handler".
	. Created two test programs for the new messaging.
	  tester1 and tester2
	. Added a changelog.
