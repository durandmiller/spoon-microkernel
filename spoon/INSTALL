This file only details how to install the tree onto your 
system so that you can make changes, compile and possibly 
boot the system if you want.



REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The system compiles perfectly on my Gentoo Linux.

1. gcc version 3.3.2 
	GNU assembler version 2.14.90.0.8 
	GNU ld version 2.14.90.0.8 

2. grub (GNU GRUB 0.94)

Anything else is not guaranteed but it will probably work.


INSTALLATION
------------


1.  Download the latest snapshot:

	wget http://www.djm.co.za/spoon/snapshot.tar.gz


2.  Extract it:

	tar -xmzvf snapshot.tar.gz

3.  Make it all:

    cd spoon
	make all


TESTING
-------

Did it work correctly?  Will it compile?

1.  View the README to get the Quick Start on how to
    compile and install.


Any errors mean that something is not happy.  Fix it 
and try again.  

If you do get errors and it has to do with source syntax
or version conflicts, please let me know: clutter at djm.co.za


BOOTING:
-------

Now you need to add the system to your GRUB menu.

This is what I'm using at the moment. Just change the
root (hd0,0) to whatever partition you have the spoon
tree on and make sure your paths are correct.

	title spoon operating system
	root (hd0,0)
	kernel /spoon/system/kernel
	module /spoon/system/init
	module /spoon/system/devfs

If you want a more appropriate/updated/comprehensive grub
menu, copy the one from the floppy.conf file but change
the root, obviously.


NOTES AND STUFF
---------------


It's important to remember that, since this is a 
microkernel, you should only load the modules that 
you will need or want to use. For example, don't 
load the ps2mouse driver if you're not in a GUI.
