/** \mainpage The Spoon C++ API


  The Spoon API is a C++ Application Programming Interface which I am designing,
  developing and implementing for the spoon operating system. It has been 
  heavily influenced by the BeOS API and, to a limited extent, the Java API. It
  is still in a state of flux as I'm constantly rethinking and reworking
  different parts of the system.
