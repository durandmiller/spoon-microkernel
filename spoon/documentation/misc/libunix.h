  If you're reading this documentation, then you're 
  probably only interested in the OS-dependent functions 
  which you need to implement in order to port the libUNIX 
  library to your particular platform.  The OS dependent 
  functions are all located in the OS subdirectories. Each
  platform has it's own subdirectory in that subdirectory.

  Here is the documentation:  \ref OSFUNCS	"OS functions."
  
  There are three steps:
  
  	- Create your own OS subdirectory.
  	- Implement the OS functions according to the documentation.
	- Edit the Makefile to compile for your particular OS.
